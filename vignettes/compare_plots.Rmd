```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Disclaimer
Plots from two different GE-runs are compared by putting them side by side. There is a little complication that the plots from the previous GE-run must be restored from an archive. This is done in a junk of shell commands.


## Comparison

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "/Volumes/data_zws/health/mar/work/bv/zws/compareBull/1904/compareBull/Comp.mar_P.mar_P.png")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "/Volumes/data_zws/health/mar/work/bv/zws/compareBull/Comp.mar_P.mar_P.png")
```

With pdf plots

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "/Volumes/data_zws/health/mar/work/bv/zws/compareBull/1904/compareBull/diff_edc_mar_P_P.pdf")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "/Volumes/data_zws/health/mar/work/bv/zws/compareBull/diff_edc_mar_P_P.pdf")
```
